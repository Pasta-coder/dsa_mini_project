Brute Force Solution: Backtracking Approach

Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Backtracking:

Time Complexity:

Worst case: O(2^(N²)) - In the worst case, we might need to explore every possible path in the maze.
The rat can make two decisions at each cell (move right or move down), and there are N² cells in total.

Space Complexity:

Solution matrix: O(N²) - To store the solution path
Recursion stack: O(N²) - In the worst case, the recursion depth could be N² (though typically less)
Total: O(N²)



Optimized Solution: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Time Complexity:

Worst case: O(N²) - In the worst case, BFS might visit all cells in the maze once.
Each cell is enqueued and dequeued at most once, and checking neighboring cells takes constant time.

Space Complexity:

Queue: O(N²) - In the worst case, all cells might be in the queue simultaneously
Visited array: O(N²) - To track visited cells
Path storage: O(N²) - To store the path for each cell in the queue
Total: O(N²)


Comparison and Optimizations:

Backtracking vs BFS:

Backtracking (DFS approach) has exponential time complexity in the worst case: O(2^(N²))
BFS has polynomial time complexity: O(N²)
BFS guarantees finding the shortest path (if both right and down moves have equal weights)
Backtracking may find any valid path, not necessarily the shortest


Memory Usage:

Backtracking uses less memory as it doesn't need to store all possible paths simultaneously
BFS requires more memory to store the queue and path information
