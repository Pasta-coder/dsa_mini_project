RAT IN A MAZE

-- 1 represents an open path the rat can travel through
-- 0 represents a blocked path
-- The rat starts at position (0,0) and needs to reach position (N-1, N-1)
-- The rat can only move in two directions: forward and down

-- The task is to find if there exists a path from the starting position to the destination, and if so, print one such path.
